            <h5>
                We want people to be able to order their food on one page instead of walking to each store and asking for a menu. This website is so you can find out what you want and by the time you get there you know what you want, or you can call them to order it. Please enjoy what we have made!!!

            <h6>
                Making this website has been a labor of love and a test of endurance that we have as a team because we have been forced to take on something more difficult than either of us ever have. Both of us have little to no experience in computer science and coding until a couple months ago. This project has made us compromises over and over again to the point we've scraped the original idea that we spent most of our time developing to do this instead. We have missed classes, had late nights, and a lot of anxiety over the quality of our final product. Whether we win or lose the completion of this website is our top priority after pouring much time and energy into it, so please enjoy. 加油!
